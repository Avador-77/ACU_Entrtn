Opening Scene: A pain that has no name



A Mysterious Nightmare:

A deep, ancient voice whispers through darkness. It’s the voice of a man...

Mysterious Voice (whispering and echoing):

"Be prepared... 
The time will be your enemy... 
Find it...your world needs you,
Find..."

The voice fades into silence. Suddenly—

[Loud noises and screams, chaos and weeps...]

Flashes of a brutal war explode across the scene. Screams. Fire. Blood. Demons tearing through cities. Chaos everywhere.
A demonic voice roars through the sky:
Demonic Voice:
"I am coming..."


Shlok jolts awake, gasping for breath. Sweat drips down his face. His eyes are wide with fear.



Shlok (panting):

"Not again... this dream... it’s getting worse..."



He clutches his left arm in pain, wincing as if someone is crushing it from inside.

Shlok (groaning):



"Aaaou... my arm... why does it hurt so much?"

He clutches his left forearm with trembling fingers. 
Skin flushed angry red—but nothing there. No bruise, no cut, no mark.
Just pain that refuses to fade. Confused and shaken

He grabs a water bottle from the bedside table and takes a few sips.



Shlok (thinking aloud):

"What is this pain? Why do I keep seeing the same dream? Those voices... they keep asking me to find something... but what? Why me?"

He takes a deep breath, trying to calm himself.



Shlok:

"I’ll find out. I have to. But for now... let’s sleep. College tomorrow. Good night."

He lies back down, thinking about all of this, and slowly drifts into uneasy sleep.


SHLOK’S HOUSE – DINING HALL – MORNING


Sunlight pours through the windows, casting a warm glow across the dining hall. The aroma of fresh parathas and chai fills the air.

Shlok walks down the stairs, still a little distracted from last night’s dream. He rubs his left wrist absentmindedly,
His mother is busy at the dining table—placing plates, pouring tea, and serving breakfast with practiced grace.

Gayatri (Mother smiling):

"Good morning, Shlok. Sit down, breakfast is almost ready."

Shlok nods and takes a seat. His father, dressed in a crisp shirt and carrying a small leather bag, is checking his watch. He’s all set to leave for his chemical factory.



Father (adjusting his bag):

"I'm getting late. I’ve got an early meeting today.
Hey Shlok, Don’t forget to ask your professor about that research project."



Shlok:

"Sure, Dad. I’ll talk to him after class."

His younger sister Vani walks in, still half-asleep, dragging her feet and yawning.


Vani (grumbling):

"Why do mornings exist? I just want five more minutes..."

Everyone chuckles. Shlok smiles faintly, but his mind is elsewhere—still haunted by the dream, the voice, and the pain in his arm.

He glances at his mother, then at his father, wondering if they know something he doesn’t. But for now, he keeps quiet.

He closes his eyes to relax. Suddenly a glimpse of yesterday's dream flashes,

Screams. That voice echoing in a void. That crushing pain again.

His breath caught. The world around him blurred, swallowed by the memory’s grip—until a familiar voice pierced through the haze.

Gayatri (concerned):
“Shlok, Shlok! Son, what happened? I was calling you, but you weren’t even listening. It’s like you weren’t even here. Is your health alright, beta? What’s the matter?”

Shlok blinked, slowly returning to the present. He took a deep breath, steadying himself.

Shlok:
“No, it’s nothing, Mom. I’m just worried about the research project. That’s all.”
She softened, walked over, cupped his face gently, and kissed his forehead.

Gayatri:
“C’mon, Shlok. You’re my brave and intelligent son. Once you get your research topic, I’m sure you’ll nail it. They’ll love your work. You’re brilliant, my child. Ummah.”
She turned toward the hallway.

Gayatri:
“Vani, Shlok, go and freshen up, both of you. I’ll prepare breakfast. And Vani, how dare you fight with your friend Avika? Her mother was complaining to me that you never talk to her nicely. That’s rude, beta.”

Vani (grumbling):
“But Mom, at least listen to me—”

Gayatri (cutting her off):
“Enough, Vani. Just go and freshen up. I don’t want her mother complaining to me again. Got it?”

Vani:
“Yeah, yeah. Fine.”

Vani got up and disappeared down the hallway toward the shower.


Shlok remained seated, absently stirring his tea. The spoon clinked against the cup, echoing like a ticking clock. His eyes stared into nothing.

Gayatri (noticed shlok):
“Shlok, tell me what happened? Why you are lost and distracted? what is it son??”

Shlok:
“Nothing, Mom. I told you, it’s just—”

Gayatri (firmly):
“Shlok, I know there’s something bothering you. Stop pretending everything’s alright.”

Shlok (sighing):
“It’s that dream I told you about. It’s a nightmare, Mom.”

Gayatri (tense):
“You saw it again? That’s the tenth time this month.”

Shlok:
“Yes, Mom. It’s happening more frequently since my 19th birthday.”

Gayatri’s expression shifted—fear flickered in her eyes.

Gayatri:
“What did you see in the dream? Can you tell me?”

Shlok (trembling):
“It’s all destruction. Bloodshed. Some brutal chaos. I hear screams, Mom. I see demons slashing people, burning villages, slaying children…”
Tears welled in his eyes.

Shlok:
“Then I hear an old man’s voice, calling me, asking me to find something—but I don’t know what. And this wrist, it pains so much… it hurts every time the nightmare comes. I feel like I’m living it, watching the destruction, helpless to stop it.”
He clutched his arm.

Shlok:
“My left arm hurts so much when I wake up. Like something is crushing it from inside. I’m so disturbed, Mom.”

Gayatri looked at him—sad, frightened, and silent.

Shlok:
“Mom, do you know anything about it? Why do I feel like you’re hiding something? What is this pain?”

Gayatri (pausing, then softly):
Gayatri’s eyes flickered to his wrist, her hand tightening around the teacup as if she might drop it.
“I told you so many times, Shlok… I’m not hiding anything. It’s just… you’re overthinking.”

Shlok (voice rising slightly):
“Then why does it feel like you’re afraid to even talk about it? Every time I bring it up, you change the subject or brush it off like it’s nothing. But it’s not nothing, Mom. It’s real. I feel it. I see it. Every night.”

Gayatri (gently):
“Beta, please… don’t do this to yourself. You’re overthinking. It’s just a dream, a bad one. That’s all.”

Shlok (frustrated):
“No, Mom. It’s not just a dream. Do you think this pain is also fake? it’s not fading, mom. It’s getting stronger. You think I’m imagining that too?”

Gayatri (struggling to stay calm):
“I’m not saying you’re imagining it. I’m saying… maybe your mind is creating it. You’re under pressure, Shlok. College, your project, your future—it’s a lot. Maybe your mind is trying to cope.”

Shlok (quietly, hurt):
“You don’t believe me.”

Gayatri (stepping closer, placing a hand on his head):
“I believe you’re scared. I believe you’re confused. And I believe you’re my son, who’s always been sensitive and curious. But sometimes, that curiosity can lead us into places we’re not ready to go.”

Shlok (pulling away slightly):
“Or maybe I’m already there, Mom. Maybe I’ve been there for a long time, and no one’s telling me why.”

Gayatri (voice trembling):
“Shlok… please. I just want you to be happy and live a normal and peaceful life. Not lost in shadows and symbols. You’re too young to carry this kind of burden.”

Shlok (softly):
“Then help me understand it. Don’t hide it from me.”

Gayatri (after a long pause, eyes moist):
“I can’t give you answers I don’t have. And even if I did… I don’t know if I’d want you to carry them.”
A heavy silence settled between them.

Gayatri (gently, trying to shift the mood):
“Listen, beta… maybe you need a break. Go on a trip with your friends. Get out of this house, this routine. Laugh a little. Breathe. You’ve always loved the hills, haven’t you? Maybe a few days away will help you forget all this… or at least see it differently.”

Shlok (quietly):
“You think this will help me foget?”

Gayatri (smiling faintly, brushing his hair back):
“I think you’ll remember who you are—beyond the dreams, beyond the pain. Just… give yourself that chance.”
Shlok didn’t respond. He looked down at his wrist, the mark hidden beneath his sleeve, still pulsing with questions.
But for now, he nodded.

Shlok stood up slowly from the dining table, his mind still heavy with the conversation.
He walked toward the staircase, each step echoing faintly in the morning stillness. Gayatri watched him go, her eyes lingering with worry, her hands still wrapped around the half-empty teacup.

Upstairs, Shlok moved through his room like a shadow—mechanically brushing his hair, adjusting his shirt, slinging his bag over one shoulder. His reflection in the mirror looked calm, but his eyes betrayed him. They held questions.

He paused for a moment, staring at his wrist beneath the sleeve. Then he pulled it down, covering it.
Downstairs, Gayatri folded a napkin and placed it beside the untouched paratha. She looked toward the hallway, waiting for the sound of his footsteps.
Shlok descended, freshly dressed, his bag hanging loosely. He walked to the door, then turned back.

Shlok (softly):
“Leaving for college, Mom.”

Gayatri stood up, walked over, and placed her hand gently on his shoulder.

Gayatri (smiling faintly):
“Bye, sweetheart. And remember what I said—don't think about that dream, just enjoy every moment. It will help.”
Shlok nodded, his expression unreadable.
He opened the door. The morning sun spilled in, warm and golden. Birds chirped somewhere in the distance. But inside him, the silence remained.
He stepped out, the door closing softly behind him.

The air was crisp, filled with the scent of dew and distant incense from a nearby temple.
His footsteps echoed softly as he walked toward the bus stop, bag slung over one shoulder, thoughts heavier than his stride.
Cars passed. A milkman cycled by. A dog barked in the distance. But Shlok heard none of it.
His mind was a storm.

Shlok (thinking):
“She’s hiding something. I know it. That pain… the dreams… and that old man's voice asking me to find, what is it that I have to find?? I think it’s all connected. And no matter how much Mom denies it, I can feel it in my bones—there’s a truth buried beneath all this. And I will find it.”
He paused at the corner, watching the college bus approach. Its yellow frame glowed in the morning light, a symbol of routine—but Shlok’s world was anything but.
The bus hissed to a stop. The door creaked open.
He climbed in, nodded at the driver, and took his usual seat by the window.
Outside, the world moved on—children laughing, vendors shouting, life unfolding.
Inside, Shlok stared at his reflection in the glass.

Shlok (thinking):
“I’m not just imagining things. I won’t stop until I know why.”
The bus turned a corner, and the college gates came into view—tall, familiar, and waiting.
Shlok exhaled slowly, bracing himself.
Today isn't just another day.
It is a beginning of something unfelt.

The college gates loomed ahead, tall and familiar, their iron bars flanked by flowering trees.
As Shlok stepped inside, the buzz of campus life wrapped around him—students chatting, laughter echoing, the distant thump of a basketball on concrete.
He walked with quiet confidence, his presence drawing nods and smiles from every corner.

“Good morning, Shlok!” a friend called out, waving.

“Hey, topper! Don’t forget us when you become famous!” another teased.

Shlok smiled politely, nodding in return. He wasn’t flashy, but his brilliance, humility, and calm demeanor had earned him respect across batches.
Professors admired his discipline. Juniors looked up to him. Even the staff greeted him with warmth.

As he neared the academic block, a sharp voice rang out—clear, confident, and unmistakably Adwita’s.
Adwita (grinning):
“There he is! The man who probably meditates in his dreams and wakes up quoting the Rigveda.”

Shlok (chuckling):
“Morning, Adwita. Still schooling people in martial arts between classes?”

Adwita:
“Only when they underestimate me. Which is often. You should join sometime—might help with your posture.”
Just then, Nishant jogged up, earbuds dangling, gym bag slung over one shoulder.

Nishant (smirking):
“Posture? He’s too busy being the campus philosopher. I bet he’s already written a thesis on the metaphysics of chai.”

Shlok:
“Not yet. But I did discover a herb that makes hostel chai taste less like punishment.”

Nishant:
“Herb? You’re speaking my language now. My grandfather swears by Brahmi for memory. I’m testing it on exam stress.”

Adwita:
“Try Tulsi instead. Brahmi’s good, but Tulsi balances the doshas better. Da says it’s the queen of herbs.”

Nishant:
“Queen of herbs? Sounds like a title you’d fight for.”

Adwita (laughing):
“Only if the crown comes with a library and a Kalari ring.”

They reached the classroom and slid into their usual seats. The room buzzed with casual chatter—students discussing assignments, memes, and weekend plans.
Nishant leaned over from the next row, eyes twinkling.

Nishant:
“Did you guys see Professor Sharma’s tweet last night? He posted a meme about prof. gupta's cat and tagged the physics department.”

Adwita (laughing):
“Classic Sharma sir. Mixing quantum mechanics with dad jokes. He’s basically a walking paradox.”

The bell rang. The professor entered. The lecture began.

[Lunch Break]:

The three friends sat under their usual tree in the courtyard, lunchboxes open, laughter flowing.

Adwita:
“Okay, serious question—if you had to be stuck in a room with one person from college for 24 hours, who would it be?”

Nishant (smirking):
“Definitely not you.”

Adwita:
“Shut up, you chatter head.”

Nishant:
“Depends. Is Wi-Fi included?”

They burst into laughter.

But the mood shifted as a group of boys approached from across the lawn—swaggering, loud, and unmistakably confrontational.

Rival Group.
At the front was Viraj (VJ)—broad-shouldered, sharp-jawed, and always simmering with barely contained rage. His eyes locked onto Shlok like a predator spotting prey.

VJ (mocking):
“Well, well. Look who’s blessing the earth with his divine presence. The great Shlok Sharma. Still hiding behind your books, or have you finally learned how to throw a punch?”

Shlok looked up calmly, unfazed.

Shlok:
“Good afternoon to you too, Viraj. I see your vocabulary hasn’t evolved since middle school.”

VJ (stepping closer):
“You think you’re better than everyone, don’t you? Just because you top every exam and walk around like some saint.”

Nishant (standing up):
“Back off, VJ. We’re just having lunch. Try not to choke on your own ego.”

VJ (ignoring him, eyes on Shlok):
“You know, Anaya was asking about you yesterday. Funny, isn’t it? She used to hang out with us. Now she’s suddenly interested in the ‘weird guy’.”

That hit a nerve.

Adwita’s eyes narrowed. Nishant clenched his jaw. Shlok’s fingers curled slightly, but his voice remained steady.

Shlok:
“If you have a problem with me, say it. Don’t drag others into your insecurities.”

VJ (smirking):
“Oh, I will. Just waiting for the right time.”

He turned and walked off, his gang following, throwing glances over their shoulders.

Nishant (muttering):
“One day, that guy’s going to push too far.”

Adwita:
“And we’ll be ready.”

Shlok (thinking):
“Let him come. I’m not afraid. Not anymore.”

A beat of silence passed. Then Nishant leaned back, eyes narrowing with memory.

Nishant:
“You know, I still remember your first week here. VJ was in full ragging mode—cornering juniors, making them do all kinds of crap.”

Adwita:
“Yeah, he thought he owned the place just because he’s the director’s son. Everyone was scared of him.”

Nishant:
“Except you. You walked right into that mess, calm as ever. Do you remember what he wanted you to do?”

Shlok (smiling faintly):
“Yeah. He wanted me and the others to kneel and chant a hymn he’d written in his own praise—like he was some kind of god.
Such a pathetic, narrow-minded imbecile. When I refused, he got enraged, growled, and came at me.
I simply looked Viraj in the eye and spoke, soft enough that only the front row heard.
“Your father signs my marksheet, not my character. Remember that.”
I told others not to fear anything born of arrogance, childish stupidity, and pure nonsense.
He then tried to punch me, but I dodged. He lost his balance and fell.”

Nishant:
“Bro, just humiliated the director’s son in 4K. That was the most satisfying thing I’ve ever seen.”

Adwita:
“Students laughed so hard. It was like we were finally free from the chains of fear due to what people like Viraj thrive on.”

Nishant:
“Exactly. His face was red, he was fuming. Everyone stood up for you. His gang just stood there like clowns after a failed show.”

Adwita (grinning):
“And then you went straight to the director. Reported everything. Saved half the batch from his nonsense.”

Nishant:
“Yeah, and the best part? VJ couldn’t touch you. You didn’t break a single rule. You just outsmarted him.”

Adwita:
“Too bad he’s the director’s son. No punishment, no warning. But his reign of terror was Over.”

Nishant:
“That’s why he hates you. You didn’t just stand up to him—you dismantled his whole image.”

Shlok (quietly):
“I didn’t do it to humiliate him. I did it because someone had to.”

Adwita:
“And that’s exactly why he’ll never beat you.”

They sat in silence for a moment, the breeze rustling the leaves above them. Somewhere deep beneath the surface, the pain in Shlok’s wrist flared again—faint, but alive.

Shlok (to Adwita and Nishant):
“You guys go ahead. I need to meet Professor Sharma about my research topic.”

Adwita:
"Research Project?? which one?"

Shlok:
"I am not so sure but I think I want to explore the works of Sage Agastya. I have few questions that I want to find answers of."

Nishant: 
"Answers, Answers, we all are chasing Answers of unknown questions!! What a philosophical mind I have, Haha!!"

Adwita:
"cut the crap, Nishh, Shlok what happened is there anything which is bothering you?"

Shlok:
"I don't know there is just a bad dream I guess and its bothering me a lot frequently. I just want to focus my mind somewhere important that's why I thought let's just dive deep in the works of Sage Agastya. I want to study him more because I feel something about him."

Nishant:
"No probs, Shloky boy, go and hunt the answers!!"

Adwita:
"Yea, go on shlok, All the best for the project work. We also have to prepare for our project."


Shlok turns back and He walks briskly to the Department of Ancient Indian History.
He reached at professor Upadhyaya's office door, shlok holds the door handle but guard interrupts

Guard: "Shlok, sir isn't inside his office. He just left urgently."

Shlok: "Where he is going?"

Guard: "Don't know, but he was looking in hurry. Do you have anything to tell him, give me the message, I will pass on to him."

Shlok: "Thank you so much but it's related to my project so I have to talk to him by myself. Can you tell me if he headed towards the parking?"

Guard: "Yes, I guess."

Shlok: "Thank You kaka"

Shlok runs towards the parking and he found professor beside his car.

Shlok: "Professor, Professor Upadhayay, Listen I need to talk to you about my project. I know you are in hurry but I will not take much of your time."

Professor interrupts him

Professor: "Shlok, not now, I have to leave urgently and I am not coming to college this whole week so whatever you have to tell me about the project, just tell that to my assistant."

Shlok: "No, Sir, I can't tell that to miss Sakshi infact, it's something personal so i need to tell that to you only."

Professor: "Shlok, try to understand, I don't have time right now. Meet me next week. I am sorry Shlok, I hope you understand."

Shlok can see a strange tension and worry on professor's face and he knew that wait is all he has to do.

Shlok : "Sure, sir, I get it. I will meet you next week."

The professor smiled at Shlok as he stepped into his car. In his hurry, a loose page slipped from his textbook and fluttered to the ground. Shlok bent down, picked it up, and froze.
Shlok (muttering):
“Shlokas… mantras… and this word—Atman Shuddhi? What is this ritual, Professor? What are you hiding?”
On the page was a strange figure: a human-like silhouette seated inside a shield, surrounded by cryptic symbols. Shlok’s brows furrowed. He tucked the page into his bag and left the college, unease gnawing at him.

That night, Shlok sat at his desk, laptop glowing in the dark. He typed “Atman Shuddhi ritual” into every search engine he could find. Nothing. Hours passed. Finally, buried in obscure references, he stumbled upon a mention of an ancient granth—written by a disciple of Sage Agastya.
Shlok (reading aloud):
“An ancient way to free a soul possessed by demonic spirits… Elite demons sent their Pischach to gather knowledge, steal weapons, and certain powers… This ritual was created by Rishi Agastya himself, during the war of gods and evils. Dangerous… only possible with the correct mantra, the Pure Stone of Liberation, and the golden rays of the divine.”
Shlok leaned back, stunned.
Shlok (thinking):
“If this is true… is Professor Upadhayay trying to perform this ritual? But on whom? And why?”

The next day, Shlok called Adwita and Nishant to his home. He laid the page and his notes on the table. Both leaned in, eyes wide.
Adwita (serious, skeptical):
“What the heck is this? This isn’t ordinary. Atman Shuddhi? Is this part of your research?”
Shlok (shaking his head):
“No, guys. The professor dropped this page when I met him yesterday. This is something serious. When I researched it, I found out this ritual is done on those whose souls are possessed by some kind of demonic spirit. And if this is true, then why did the professor have it? I’m sure he’s onto something.”
Nishant (frowning, doubtful):
“Wait, wait. Are you saying Professor Upadhayay is involved in… this? Come on, Shlok. He’s a scholar, not some occult practitioner. Maybe it’s just part of his research notes.”
Adwita (crossing her arms):
“Exactly. Professors deal with manuscripts all the time. Why jump to conclusions? This looks bizarre, but it doesn’t mean he’s planning a ritual.”
Shlok (leaning forward, voice firm):
“You don’t understand. I saw his face yesterday. His eyes… there was fear, tension. He wasn’t just carrying research. He was hiding something. And this page proves it.”
Nishant (hesitant):
“Still… demons, rituals, possession? It sounds unreal. Why would he even risk something like this?”
Shlok (passionate, almost pleading):
“Because he’s desperate. Look at these symbols—this isn’t ordinary. And the text says it’s dangerous, only possible with mantras, a liberation stone, and divine light. Why would he have this if he wasn’t planning something? Think about it. If he’s trying to perform this ritual, someone’s life is at stake.”
Adwita (softening, uneasy):
“You really believe this, don’t you? That he’s hiding something dangerous?”
Shlok (nodding, resolute):
“I know it. I can feel it. We can’t ignore this. If we sit back, we might regret it later. We need to find out the truth.”
Nishant (after a pause, exchanging a glance with Adwita):
“…Alright. If you’re this sure, then we’ll help. But we need to be careful. If the professor is really planning something, we can’t just walk into it blindly.”
Adwita (reluctantly, but convinced):
“Okay. What’s the plan?”
Shlok (calm but determined):
“I’ve planned it all. Nishant, you talk to the guard and tell him that whenever the professor leaves suspiciously, he needs to inform us. Then we’ll follow him.”
Nishant (finally agreeing):
“Consider it done.”

Two days later, the guard tipped them off. The professor was leaving in haste. The trio jumped on their bikes, following at a distance. The road wound toward Adwita’s neighborhood. Her stomach tightened.
Adwita (uneasy):
“Wait… this is my lane. Don’t tell me…”
They stopped at a corner. From afar, they saw Professor Upadhayay ring the bell at Adwita’s house. Acharya Vaidyanath, Adwita’s grandfather, opened the door.
Adwita (whispering):
“Da? He knows the professor? He never told me about this!”
Shlok:
“Adwita, who is Da? Your grandfather?”
Adwita:
“Yeah, he’s my grandfather. I call him Da. How do they know each other? That’s interesting. I think you were right, Shlok—the professor is planning something.”
Nishant:
“But why would the professor meet your grandpa? What does he have to do with all this?”
Adwita:
“I think I know why. See, my grandpa is… Acharya Vaidyanath.”
Shlok and Nishant (astonished):
“The Acharya Vaidyanath? That yogi, mystic, and scholar of ancient scrolls and spiritual sciences?”
Adwita:
“Yes. He possesses knowledge of ancient scriptures, granthas, mantras, and rituals. He has done several researches in various fields. That’s why I think the professor is meeting him—he wants his help.”

Adwita tried to ask her grandfather in several ways if he was planning to go somewhere this week or had any plans, but she didn’t succeed. When nothing worked, she came up with a plan. She decided to learn the vanishing spell her grandpa used to tell her about when she was young. Although she wasn’t sure if such a spell existed, she suspected her grandfather might have researched it.
She asked her grandpa for access to his library where ancient books were kept. She told him she needed to find a topic for her research and for that she needed to refer to some books. When Adwita entered the library, she started searching through his works and found a book he had never published. It was titled “The Art of Invisibility.” She grabbed the book and secretly rescued it from the library.
After spending three to four days learning the spell, she was finally able to perform it for approximately ten minutes. Adwita planned to secretly enter her grandpa’s room at night and search for clues about the Salvation Chamber. She was sure she would find something on his table where he mostly sat.

That night, Adwita kept watch. When her grandfather left his study, she whispered the vanishing spell and slipped inside. She needed to hurry because she knew the spell could only last ten minutes. She searched frantically—bookshelves, desk, scrolls. Nothing. Then footsteps. Her grandfather returned. Adwita froze, hands over her mouth.
He sat at his desk, thinking. After a minute, he took a candle jar filled with melted wax and whispered a mantra. The wax swirled, solidified into a candle, and ignited on its own. As the candle lit, the center of the room began melting in a circle. The furniture, table, wardrobes, and every other object in the room melted and slipped into the hole, forming stairs descending into a giant dark chamber. The ignited candle floated into the hole, followed by her grandfather.
Adwita (thinking):
“This… this is the chamber.”
She silently followed him.
After passing through a narrow passage, she entered a large chamber beneath the house. It was the size of a big auditorium. A man floated in mid-air, unconscious, bound by invisible chains. Her grandfather stood before him, watching. Before she could process, her spell began to fade. She fled in panic to her room, tears in her eyes, thinking about what her grandfather was going to do with that person. She clearly felt the upcoming threats and fears.


The next morning, Adwita told Shlok and Nishant everything. Shock rippled through them.
Nishant:
“A man… floating? Possessed?”
Shlok:
“I knew it. We need to see it ourselves. Whatever they’re planning, we can’t let it happen unchecked.”
Adwita:
“Yes, so I have a plan. If they are planning to do it in that chamber, then they will do it at midnight. So, you come to my house before midnight and we will keep an eye. When the professor reaches my house, we will go inside that chamber.”
Shlok:
“But do you remember the mantra to open the chamber?”
Adwita:
“Yeah, I know. But we have to be very careful down there. It might happen that they feel our presence, and then everything will be spoiled.”
Shlok:
“And that’s why only I will go down there, and you two will stay outside. Even if I get into some trouble, you can rescue me. I don’t want all of us to get into danger.”
Adwita and Nishant:
“But Shlok, it can be dangerous. We don’t even know what they are going to do down there!”
Shlok:
“I know, but that’s what we have to find out—what they will do to that person. Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.”

[The Night of the Ritual]
Adwita called Shlok and Nishant.
Adwita:
"Guys, I know it's 8:00 PM, but can you come here? I am not getting good vibes in my own house. It's very strange—I don’t feel safe in my house."
Shlok:
"Adwita, don’t panic, alright. Everything is fine and we are coming, okay? Just keep your back door open. We’ll call you when we reach, alright?"
Adwita:
"Yes, okay."
Shlok and Nishant arrived, and Adwita helped them get into the house.
They waited for the professor’s arrival, and at 11:00 PM, the professor arrived.
Acharya and the professor both went inside Acharya’s room.
Nishant:
"But how do we know when they will enter the chamber?"
Adwita:
"Don’t worry, I know a spell to see through the wall."
Shlok:
"I didn’t know you were this good in these mantra shaktis and all."
Adwita:
"Well, this is what I have inherited from my parents. It’s a legacy."
Shlok and Nishant were proud and amazed at the same time.
Around 11:45 PM, they opened the chamber’s door. Adwita, Nishant, and Shlok entered Acharya’s room.
Nishant:
"Wow, what a room—classic ancient vibes."
Adwita:
"Stop it, Nishant. Not now."
Adwita asked both of them to stay away from the center of the room and not to touch any furniture.
Both Shlok and Nishant were ready to witness the magical revelation of the Salvation Chamber’s door.
She chanted the mantra, “Deep Prakashitam.”
Everything in the room started melting, forming stairs into the hole.
Shlok and Nishant were astonished and perplexed to see something like this. They couldn’t believe their eyes.
Adwita:
"Shlok, now go. I am doing the invisible chant on you, and you will be invisible for almost 10 minutes. So don’t stay there for more than 10 minutes, okay? Please be safe."
Shlok nodded and started descending the stairs carefully. As he reached the Salvation Chamber, he saw that the professor and Acharya were chanting mantras. The unconscious man writhed, his eyes glowing white. A black fog seeped from his mouth, pressing against the weakening magical wall that contained him. The black entity laughed demonically because it was too strong to be controlled.
The professor was continuously chanting the mantra, and Acharya was holding a stone facing toward the man.
Professor (frustrated):
“The mantra isn’t working! The wall is breaking!”
Acharya (grim):
“The moonlight isn’t strong enough to blend with my golden spell. I thought this would work, but we need the golden light. Without it, the ritual will fail. Keep chanting the mantra.”
Shlok was shocked and stunned seeing all this. He couldn’t believe that the professor and Acharya were fighting something supernatural. It reminded him of his mysterious nightmare in which he experienced demons’ voices, screams, and chaos. It made him frightened and weak. He wanted to help them…
In that very moment, Shlok’s wrist started bursting with pain. This time the pain was immensely high—so strong that Shlok couldn’t tolerate it. He stopped his scream and held his wrist tightly, but he saw his wrist start to show a faint golden mark, symbols emerging. As soon as he could register all of this, pain surged even more through his arm. He screamed, collapsing. The invisible spell broke. His wrist burst with golden light. A trishul (a divine trident of Lord Shiva) erupted from his skin, blazing with divine energy. The chamber shook. Shlok’s eyes rolled back as he fell unconscious.
The golden rays of the divine fell directly on the Liberation Stone and reflected back to the demon. Seeing this, it screamed in fear and finally became trapped inside the stone.
